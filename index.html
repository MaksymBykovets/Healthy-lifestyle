    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
    <p>Nutrition is the biochemical and physiological process by which an organism uses food to support its life. <br>
     It provides organisms with nutrients, which can be metabolized to create energy and chemical structures. <br>
     Failure to obtain the required amount of nutrients causes malnutrition. Nutritional science is the study of nutrition, <br>
     though it typically emphasizes human nutrition.</p>

    <h2>Exercise</h2>
    <p>Exercise is physical activity that enhances or maintains fitness and overall health which is performed for various reasons, <br>
    including weight loss or maintenance, to aid growth and improve strength, develop muscles and the cardiovascular system, prevent injuries, <br>
    hone athletic skills, improve health, or simply for enjoyment. Many people choose to exercise outdoors where they can congregate in groups, <br>
    socialize, and improve well-being as well as mental health.</p>

    <h2>Sleep</h2>
    <p>Sleep is a state of reduced mental and physical activity in which consciousness is altered and certain sensory activity is inhibited. <br>
    During sleep, there is a marked decrease in muscle activity and interactions with the surrounding environment. While sleep differs from <br>
    wakefulness in terms of the ability to react to stimuli, it still involves active brain patterns, making it more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness.</p>
